# RNA-ligand
Scoring function to predict binding affinity of RNA-drug complexes. 
This scoring function is built to predict the binding affinity of RNA-Drug complexes.
## Intstructions to use: 
First save the PDB files in your working directory. Then use all the three features code RNA specific features, Drug specific features and Complex specific features.These codes will extract all the features in a saperate files in .CSV format. The merge all the files of features make it one and save it in your working directory.
